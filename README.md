CHALLENGE: Tip of the Day Application
Create an Ionic application that displays a random “tip” or small quote each day. This will be a simple one page application, so make it look as nice as possible - make sure to utilise Ionic’s UI components for the interface.

Requirements:

The “tip” should be supplied from a data source containing 5-10 tips
The tip should only change on a new day, not every time the application is opened
Customise the primary and secondary colours Ionic provides and make use of those in the application
Implement a background colour (not white)
Use custom CSS styles to make the font look nicer/more interesting
Optional:

Make the background colour random (picked from pre-determined array of colours) each time the application is opened
Restrictions:

The data for the tips must be provided by a local tips.json file and loaded into the application via an HTTP request
The tip must be provided to the page by a TipsService.
